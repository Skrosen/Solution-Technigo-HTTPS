          HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. The S in HTTPS ensures the user a secure website where it's safe to exchange personal data. To guarantee that the data is safely transfered with HTTPS the website needs to use a security certificate. 
          <br>
          <br>
          The security is ensured through a SSL och TLS Certificate which is used to authenticate the identity of the website, without any of these certificates the website tranfers data with HTTP and therefore unencrypted wich puts the users personal information at risk. 
          SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) uses public key encryption to ensure security and authenticate the server, client and at the same time encrypts the data.

          Most websties uses HTTPS by default, regardless if sensitive data might be exchanged or not. Google is actually flagging websites without SSL or TLS protection as <i style="font-style: italic">not secure</i> and is also penalizing those websites. 
          <br>
          <br>
          You can se that a website uses HTTPS in the url in front of the webaddress. Most secure websites also display a lock on the top of the page wich indicates that the exchange of data is transfered securely and encrypted. It looks like this:
