This is my solution to the Technigo Remote Frontend Program.

The solution gives you a short introduction to HTTPS and what it means to have a website secured with SLL or TLS. It also provides information on how you make sure the website you are using is a secure website. It provides two links to other websites where you can learn more about HTTPS, clicking on the link will take you directly to the websites information about HTTPS. There is also an embedded YouTube-video that visualises how HTTPS works and you can watch the YouTube-video in directly on the website.

To try my solution just download the project and open the index.html file in any web browser. 

Enjoy!
