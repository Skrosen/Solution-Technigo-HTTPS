This is my solution to the Technigo Remote Frontend Program.

The task is to explain a given word, in my case HTTPS, do a little bit of research on the word and then create a small webpage to explain it. There is no given way to style the page but it must contain:
* A title
* A paragraph of text to explain the definition your word/term (~100 words)
* Three links to useful resources so one can read more

My solution gives you a short introduction to HTTPS and what it means to have a website secured with SLL or TLS certificate. It also provides information on how you make sure the website you are using is a secure website. It provides two links to other websites where you can learn more about HTTPS, clicking on the link will take you directly to the websites and their information on HTTPS. As the third link I decided to use an embedded YouTube-video that visualises how HTTPS works for those who prefer to learn by watching and listening rather than reading. You can watch the YouTube-video in directly on the website.

To test my solution just download the project, mark and open the index.html, style.css and png file in any web browser. 

Enjoy!
