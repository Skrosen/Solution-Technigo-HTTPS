This is my solution to the Technigo Remote Frontend Program.

The solution gives you a short introduction to HTTPS and what it means to have a website secured with SLL or TLS. It also provides information on how you make sure the website you are using is a secure website. It also provides three links to other websites where you can learn more about HTTPS.

Enjoy!
